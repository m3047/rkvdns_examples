  <p>Provided with a <em>hostname</em> (fqdn), does the following:
    <ol>
      <li>Perform an address lookup of the hostname.</li>
      <li>Query an <a href="https://github.com/m3047/rkvdns">RKVDNS</a> proxy to extract
          netflow peers from a Redis database.
      </li>
      <li>Perform reverse (PTR) DNS lookups on the peer addresses to get the resource names.
          The PTR records are synthesized with <a href="https://github.com/m3047/rear_view_rpz">Rear View RPZ</a>.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>Advantages of this approach are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>Separation of netflow and DNS monitoring concerns.</li>
      <li>Tactical flexibility in monitoring, distributed close to endpoints.</li>
      <li>Meaningful, relevant reverse (PTR) lookups.</li>
    </ul>
    This is not a DNS exfil or C&amp;C detection tool, but a comprehensive mapping of resource
    discovery to data exchange activity.
  </p>
  <h2><a name="discussion"></a>Discussion</h2>
  <p>One of the key design considerations of this approach is separation of the concerns of DNS and
     netflow monitoring. This is supposed to be tactical code; it is intended to be ridiculously easy
     to deploy, with minimal external dependencies. The general installation instructions are: clone
     the required GitHub repositories into the same directory (e.g. <code>/usr/local/share</code>),
     install python prerequisites, configure, run.
  </p>
  <p>Arguably the most difficult aspect of this integrated solution is obtaining and configuring a
     caching DNS server (e.g. <cite>BIND</cite> or <cite>Unbound</cite>) with Dnstap and 
     Response Policy Zones (RPZ). If you look
     at some of these projects (ShoDoFlo and Rear View RPZ in particular) you will find additional
     documentation addressing these concerns.
  </p>
  <p>In my opinion these are worthwhile tactical capabilities:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Dnstap</b> -- application level DNS traffic inspection telemetry generated within the nameserver</li>
      <li><b>RPZ</b> -- equivalent of a <cite>web application firewall</cite> for DNS, and more</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h3><a name="rkvdns_proxy"></a>RKVDNS Proxy</h3>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/m3047/rkvdns">RKVDNS</a> proxies a Redis database via DNS lookups.</p>
  <p>In this case our database contains netflow data, populated by the
     <a href="https://github.com/m3047/shodohflo/blob/master/agents/pcap_agent.py">ShoDoHFlo pcap agent</a>.
     You can collect this data in any way which is convenient to you.
  </p>
  <p>This particular database has a key for each peer; each key starts with the address associated
     with the hostname in question. We use a Redis <code>keys</code> query to get all of the netflow
     records for that hostname, and then extract the peer addresses.
  </p>
  <p>For proper operation the proxy needs to listen on port 53, the standard DNS port, and in most
     &quot;off the shelf&quot; environments this requires <code>root</code> access.
  </p>
  <h3><a name="rear_view_rpz"></a>Rear View RPZ</h3>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/m3047/rear_view_rpz">Rear View RPZ</a> utilizes Dnstap telemetry to populate
     a (DNS) zone with synthesized PTR (reverse lookup) records. This zone is then configured as an RPZ,
     overriding the globally defined values when local knowledge is available.
  </p>
  <p>This takes control of reverse lookups away from the cloud providers and gives it to you.</p>
  <p>You don't have to have locally synthesized PTR records, but your hit rate will be as low as 50%.
     Here is a <a href="https://github.com/m3047/rear_view_rpz/blob/main/utilities/PTR_Recs_Useless.md">writeup
     on the sorry state</a> of PTR records today.
  </p>
  <h3><a name="dns_monitoring"></a>DNS Monitoring</h3>
  <p>The data collection is intended to happen as close to the endpoint devices as possible: the caching
     resolver configured for that network segment. Sometimes there will be simple forwarders (e.g. <cite>dnsmasq</cite>)
     between the endpoints and the actual caching resolver; that's ok. Local is better.
  </p>
  <p>If you have several endpoint networks under your control, the advantage of capturing the host &larr;&rarr; address
     mappings in a zone file becomes clear: you can use (the DNS) zone transfer facility to aggregate the collected
     data in a central location (where you can also utilize them as RPZs if you wish). Bear in mind that utilizing
     these zones as RPZs is convenient, but there are other ways to consume or extract the data from zone files.
  </p>
  <h3><a name="netflow_monitoring"></a>Netflow Monitoring</h3>
  <p>Simply put, if you want to identify specific devices then network traffic (netflow) monitoring needs to
     happen on the endpoint side of any network address translation (NAT) horizon, because on the other side
     of that horizon, all endpoints within it are collapsed into a single address.
  </p>
  <p>The <a href="https://github.com/m3047/shodohflo/blob/master/agents/pcap_agent.py">ShoDoHFlo pcap agent</a> is
     written in Python, there are more performant options available (this works for me, YMMV).
     The agent puts the observed netflows into a
     Redis database; we then proxy the Redis data to DNS with RKVDNS. You don't have to use ShoDoHFlo's agent,
     if you populate the same keys then everything else will keep working. If you have something else writing
     netflows to Redis then you may have to change the DNS query which RKVDNS uses (and the extraction logic
     that this script uses). If you don't have Redis,
     then you'll need to find some other way to proxy the data to DNS because RKVDNS specifically works with
     Redis. Unfortunately there is no "all the things" equivalent to the DNS zone transfer because of the
     dynamic nature of the data in question.
  </p>
  <p>Although the actual netflow capture needs to occur on the endpoint network, neither Redis or RKVDNS needs
     to live there, nor do Redis and RKVDNS need to live in the same place. Having the Redis instance upstream
     (farther) from the endpoint network should be no problem from a NAT standpoint. However like Redis, the
     RKVDNS proxy needs to receive (DNS) requests from clients so it cannot be behind a NAT horizon from the
     perspective of those clients without a static NAT mapping allowing the clients access.

Help on module peers:

NAME
    peers - Netflow Peers.

DESCRIPTION
    Command line:
    
        peers.py &lt;fqdn&gt; [&lt;rkvd-domain&gt; [&lt;dns-server&gt;]] {+debug} {+addr[esses]}
        
    Lists, symbolically when possible, the netflow peers of the specified host.
    
        fqdn         This is the (resolvable) fully qualified hostname, or an address.
        rkvd-domain  The domain that rkvdns serves responses under.
        dns-server   This is the (optional) dns server to use for DNS requests.
        debug        If specified (preceded by '+') then intermediate results are
                     printed to STDOUT.
        addresses    The addresses are printed after the hostnames in all cases, not just
                     when the reverse lookup fails.
        
    Corresponding entries can be set in an optional `configuration.py`:
    
        DOMAIN      Akin to a search list, this is the domain to be appended to the
                    hostname/fqdn.
        RKVDNS      The domain that rkvdns serves responses under. See below.
        SERVER      The address of the dns server.
        
    Refer to the documentation for RKVDNS. Our query will be fabricated into a domain
    name looking something like
    
        address;*;flow.keys.proxy.redis.example.com
    
    The RKVDNS domain in this example is proxy.redis.example.com
    
    Order of Operation
    ------------------
    
    1) fqdn / hostname is resolved.
    
        Unless the name parses as an IPv4 or IPv6 address, it is resolved with A / AAAA
        queries to identify the actual address. IPv6 is preferred.
        
        If DOMAIN is defined, then it is appended to the fqdn (unless it matches the
        righthand side of the fqdn) before attempting DNS resolution.
        
    2) Uses rkvdns to query a redis database containing flow information.
    
        There is a Redis database with keys conforming to the following pattern:
        
            &lt;client&gt;;&lt;peer&gt;;&lt;port&gt;;flow
            
        Notice that this is case sensitive, that is "flow" is lower case.
        
        The address established in step 1 is queried for as client keys:
        
            "&lt;resolved-address&gt;;*;flow"
        
        The Redis database is maintained by pcap-agent.
        (https://github.com/m3047/shodohflo/blob/master/agents/pcap_agent.py)
        
    3) Reverse (PTR) lookups are performed for each &lt;peer&gt;
    
        Straightforward. Personally however I'm using a nameserver which offers
        synthesized PTR records, increasing my coverage to over 90%; good luck if
        you even get 50% accuracy with normal DNS.
        
        I synthesize PTR records with Rear View RPZ.
